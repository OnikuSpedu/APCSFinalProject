**Brief Project Description:**

For our final project, we are going to create a photo editor similar to Photoshop in Processing. This photo editor would allow users to import a photo from their computer and edit it in the application, and they can save their work at the end. Some features include using kernels to convolute the image, drawing on the picture with various colors, and adding stickers. Image convolution with kernels should account for the border pixels by using edge extension.

**Installation Instructions:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the PhotoEditor/PhotoEditor.pde file in the Processing editor.
4. Download the UIBooster library.
5. Click the "run" button in the Processing editor.

## ðŸ“ƒ Development Log
### May 24, 2021 (Monday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Created a dev branch to ensure that the main branch always has functioning code. Created initial files and global variables for color palette.
    
- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Experimented with file handling for importing and saving images. Discovered that you can successfully choose a file to load in, edit and save it under a specific directory name, and access all of the images under a directory as an array.
    
### May 25, 2021 (Tuesday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Designed Figma sketches for how the different screens in the app would look.

- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Created a Sandbox directory in the dev branch where all the experimental code snippets can be stored for later use. Also found out that I was using wrong vocabulary term: it is not normalization that handles edges; it is edge extension.
    
### May 26, 2021 (Wednesday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Created an abstract class called UiElement so that UI elements can be displayed and interacted with easily. Created the initial parts of the toolbar and sidebar. Created Button class with on press and on hover rendering.

- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Worked on creating abstract UiElement class and Button class along with Shadman while he screenshared.
    
### May 28, 2021 (Friday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Created start screen. Implemented buttons to move between the start screen and upload screen. Created controlled input elements to take canvas width and height.

- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Implemented modified kernel convolution algorithm complete with edge extension to handle the border pixels.

### May 29, 2021 (Saturday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Created canvas and layer classes. Connected start screen create and import buttons to the editor screen through initializing a canvas. Loaded images into 2D color arrays. Created buttons and corresponding methods to create new transparent layers and import a new image as a layer. Created a display method for canvas that uses alpha compositing to render the layers and preserve the transparent effect. Merged and resolved conflicts in Rickey's code and my code.

- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Completely overhauled/updated the UML diagram and added it to the prototype.

### May 31, 2021 (Monday)
- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Fixed bugs within Shadman's code which were based on the fact that images in Processing are x by y while 2D arrays are created, traversed, and accessed by row, col order. Created the FilterScreen class and corresponding classes and methods to let the user apply a filter to their image using kernel convolution.

### June 3, 2021 (Thursday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Created a UI interface so that users can select layers and change a layer's names. I also created a basic draw tool.
- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Completed the FilterScreen with all 8 kernel filter options. Created and completed the SaveScreen where users can save their work or continue working.

### June 4, 2021 (Friday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Added color selection for draw tool. Added a way to drag layers. Started creating a toolbar.
    
### June 5, 2021 (Saturday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Removed the pen and move layer tools. Refactored PhotoEditor code to make the code more modular, less redundant, and cleaner. Updated UiElement to include commonly user methods like isHovering. Added a variable in screen to store an arraylist of ui elements. Fixed inconsistent composition array dimensions.

### June 6, 2021 (Sunday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Added default display method to UiElement. Created a layer move tool and a draw tool. Created toolbar UI for move and draw tool. 
- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Fixed two major bugs in the project: choosing a color from the color selector not updating and the thumbnail previews for the filters not changing after re-editing.

### June 7, 2021 (Monday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Added delete layer button. Added layer opacity button. Fixed calculate compositon bug. Hid add layer buttons when there are 7 or more layers. Added a thickness input.

### June 8, 2021 (Tuesday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Added a checkerboard pattern to the canvas to indicate transparency. Fixed canvas coordinate system. Added board around selected layers. Fixed the draw tool. Fixed bucket tool. Added draw tool roundness and necessary input in editor screen. Added buttons to swap layer positions.
- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Completed the bucket tool and completed the eraser tool.

### June 9, 2021 (Wednesday)
- **Shadman** ðŸ§°  
    Fixed eraser roundness and radius. Fixed bucket tolerance bug. Added validation for all text inputs. Fixed layer opacity button bug and layer border bug.
- **Rickey** ðŸŽˆ  
    Worked with Shadman to find bugs and fix them. Fixed the isSomewhatEqual method for bucket tool where black ink would fill the whole canvas despite there being a black perimeter. Fixed the bug where the stagedPhoto can sometimes stay null when the user goes to the previous screen after not having chosen a filter.
